<HTML><BODY>Many people love to speculate about extraterrestrial life, both serious scientists and for entertainment. Libraries full of books on the subject have been written. One of the earliest works that wasn't purely philosophical, but took into account the state of scientific knowledge at the time was the Cosmotheoros by the famous Dutch scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens">Christiaan Huygens</a> (1629–1695). The work was published posthumously, in 1698 in Latin, and was translated into English the same year. Translations in other languages, including Dutch, quickly followed.

<p>The edition here is a printing from 1722 (<a href="https://archive.org/details/b30537009_0001/page/n5/mode/2up">source</a>). A text version of the first English edition (1668) already <a href="https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/huygens/huygens_ct_en.htm">exists</a>, but comes with a copyright claim, so I decided still to run it here to contribute it to Project Gutenberg.

</p><p>While proof-reading this text <b>please use the long-s ( ſ ) character where it is used in the printed original</b>. Please DO NOT replace it with a normal (modern) s, and please DO NOT use the letter eff ( f ), which the OCR produced. The ſ differs from the f in the size of its vertical bar.

</p><p>Please place side-notes next to the line the start at, between brackets and retain line-breaks in them.

</p><p>The side-note on the top-left or right (aka shoulder-note) saying Book I or Book II need not be retained. The single word in the bottom right (catchword) can also be removed. It indicates the first word or syllable on the next page.

</p><p>Have fun!
